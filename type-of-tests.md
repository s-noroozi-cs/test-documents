# Unit testing
	
* Unit testing is a methodology where units of code are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. 
	
* A unit test might test a particular function, object, class, or module. 

* Unit tests are great to learn whether or not individual parts of an application work.

# Integration testing
	
* unit tests don’t test whether or not units work together when they’re composed to form a whole application. 

* You need integration tests, which can be collaboration tests between two or more units, or full end-to-end functional tests of the whole running application (aka system testing). 

# Behavior Driven Development / Behavior testing

* BDD is a branch of Test Driven Development (TDD). 

* BDD uses human-readable descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests.

* Like Domain Driven Design (DDD), an early step in BDD is the definition of a shared vocabulary between stakeholders, domain experts, and engineers. 

* This process involves the definition of entities, events, and outputs that the users care about, and giving them names that everybody can agree on.

* BDD practitioners then use that vocabulary to create a domain specific language they can use to encode system tests such as User Acceptance Tests (UAT).

* Each test is based on a user story written in the formally specified ubiquitous language based on English. (A ubiquitous language is a vocabulary shared by all stakeholders.)
