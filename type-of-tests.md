* Unit testing
	
	- Unit testing is a methodology where units of code are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. 
	
	- A unit test might test a particular function, object, class, or module. 

	- Unit tests are great to learn whether or not individual parts of an application work.

Integration testing
	
	- unit tests don’t test whether or not units work together when they’re composed to form a whole application. 

	- You need integration tests, which can be collaboration tests between two or more units, or full end-to-end functional tests of the whole running application (aka system testing). 

Behavior Driven Development / Behavior testing

	- BDD is a branch of Test Driven Development (TDD). 

	- BDD uses human-readable descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests.

	- Like Domain Driven Design (DDD), an early step in BDD is the definition of a shared vocabulary between stakeholders, domain experts, and engineers.
